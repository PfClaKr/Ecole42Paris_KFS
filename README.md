# KFS (Kernel From Scratch) - Custom Operating System in Rust

## About

**KFS (Kernel From Scratch)** is an operating system development project at Ã‰cole 42 that involves building a functional kernel using Rust. This multi-stage project explores low-level systems programming, hardware interaction, and operating system architecture by creating a bootable kernel with progressively more advanced features across four distinct stages.

The project leverages Rust's safety guarantees and modern language features while working at the bare metal level, demonstrating how modern systems programming can benefit from memory safety without sacrificing performance or low-level control.
